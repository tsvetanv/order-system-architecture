# C4 Architecture Model

This folder represents the **C4 model views** of the Order Processing System.

The C4 model is used to describe the system architecture at multiple levels of abstraction:
- Context
- Container
- Component (future)
- Code (out of scope)

## Iteration 1 Scope

In the first iteration:
- DSL files will be created later in current iteration
- Other diagram files will be defined in the next iterations

Diagrams will be introduced incrementally once:
- System boundaries are stable
- Responsibilities are clearly defined

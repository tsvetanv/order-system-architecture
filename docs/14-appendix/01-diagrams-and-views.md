## Diagram Terminology

Explain briefly:

* what “diagram” means
* what “view” means
* why both terms exist

## Diagram ↔ C4 View Mapping Table

Exactly like this (you can reuse this verbatim later):

* Diagram (Documentation / Presentation)	C4 / Structurizr View
* System Context Diagram	System Context View
* Architecture Overview Diagram	Container View
* Runtime Workflow Diagram	Dynamic View
* Infrastructure Diagram	Deployment View

## Tooling Note (Optional but Nice)

One short paragraph:

* Structurizr DSL is used to define C4 views
* Diagrams are rendered via Structurizr Site Generator
* Naming in docs may differ intentionally for clarity
* This reinforces Architecture as Code thinking.

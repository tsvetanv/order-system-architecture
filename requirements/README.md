# Architecture Requirements

This folder contains the **architectural requirements** for the Order Processing System.

At this stage, requirements are intentionally kept **high-level and consolidated**
to allow evolution of the architecture without premature structure decisions.

## Scope

The requirements will cover:
- Business drivers and goals
- Functional capabilities at system level
- Non-functional and quality attributes (scalability, reliability, security, etc.)

## Evolution Plan

As the architecture evolves, this folder may be extended with:
- business.md
- functional.md
- non-functional.md

# Architecture Requirements – Order Processing System

This folder contains the **architectural input artifacts** for the Order Processing System.

These documents capture the foundational information required to design, evolve, and validate the system architecture before introducing diagrams, infrastructure, or implementation details.

The goal is to:
- establish a shared domain language
- define clear system boundaries
- record initial stakeholder expectations
- enable traceability and automation (Architecture as Code)

## Structure

- **domain.md**  
  Defines the domain language: actors, core concepts, and relationships used consistently across architecture, code, and documentation.

- **scope.md**  
  Defines what the Order Processing System is responsible for and what is explicitly out of scope.

- **requirements-raw.md**  
  Captures the raw, uncategorized output of initial stakeholder interviews.

## Notes

- These artifacts represent **Iteration 1 – Architectural Inputs**
- Requirements are intentionally not yet categorized or prioritized
- All future architecture models (C4, ADRs, validation rules, IaC) must trace back to these inputs
